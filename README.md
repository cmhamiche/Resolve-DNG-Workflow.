Works with the free DaVinci Resolve version. This is a base grade for DNG using a fusion composition with AgX and a simple power grade.

Put uncompress the Grades folder in C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\
In the Fusion tab, import the Fusion Composition.
In the Color tab, import the Power Grade and adjust temperature and exposure values in Camera Raw.

Default is raw interpreted as rec.709/srgb to srgb/AgX Punchy.
