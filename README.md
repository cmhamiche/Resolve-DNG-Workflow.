Works with the free DaVinci Resolve version. This is a base grade for DNG using a fusion composition with AgX and a simple power grade.

Uncompress the Grades folder in C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\
In the Fusion tab, import the Fusion Composition named AgX.comp.
In the Color tab, import the Power Grade named AgX.drx and adjust temperature and exposure values in Camera Raw.

Default is raw interpreted as rec.709/srgb to srgb/AgX Punchy but you can use linear and base AgX for exemple.
